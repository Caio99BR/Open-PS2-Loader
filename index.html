		<h2>TODO:</h2>
		<p>* I need to configure 'git' in TravisCI to upload link to new builds (like here <a href="https://benlimmer.com/2013/12/26/automatically-publish-javadoc-to-gh-pages-with-travis-ci/">REF #1</a> or here <a href="https://gist.github.com/domenic/ec8b0fc8ab45f39403dd">REF #2</a> to this page</p>
		<p>* Trigger a build after one-week (transfer.sh delete files and 14-days)</p>
		<p>* Update this site</p>
